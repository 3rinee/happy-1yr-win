                If you ever see this, it either means you finally contacted me back or I couldn't help but break contact again. The reason I went and made this is because, first, I'm bored. Right as I'm typing this out, it's February 12, 1:09am. I'd just finish catching up to all my work, made my flashcards, did my notes, reviewed everything, and yeah! I think I'll work on this website as I want a hobby or something. 

Anyways, in terms of why I made another website for you. I'm not trying to impress you, oo. I wanted to make it a bit better and appropriate to our situation now incase you wanted to visit this website again. If you want to see the 2023 version, there's a little section at the top where you can click and you'll see everything there. Hmmm, I think by the time you'll most likely see this, you'll be in college na. Not sure when I'll send this, but I'll be coming home on December 2026, hopefully we see each other somewhere? Catch up? Who am I kidding, di siguro ano hehe. 

Congrats on another milestone! I'm sure by the time you're reading this, your nerdy little self is in Computer Engineering na, somewhere in Manila? City boy ka na pala ha? I'm so proud of you. I'm glad you're thriving and taking a step closer to your dreams. I always admired the passion you had for your future career and how you never wavered no matter what. 

Hmmm, what else do I wanna say. I don't really have anything in mind right now. I'm just so happy right now writing this, thinking about you and reminiscing! I feel like a little girl trying to be friends with another kid eh. I'm not expecting a response once I send this randomly and you never contact me again. I respect you, but I probably won't send it if you never contact me anyways. 

I'll probably put this in the same address as the old website, so if you open it, tadaaa! C'mon, atleast email me about it if you ever see it? I'm kidding! (No, I'm not. Share your thoughts with me, dali na?) Orrr, add me back on social media? Yes, Cath, Great idea. 

Oh! Anddd! I'm sure you saw the email, I have panda now tooo!! I might buy a new one when I get home dyan ulit. I want the cat one so bad, the one similar to yours but not exactly yours. Hopefully the kids are doing great with you, dad. 

Ano pa ba. Hm. Oh and hopefully you haven't cut off your friends pag lumipat ka paalis dyan sainyo because diba yun sabi mo? I wish you a strong and steady friendship with everyone you meet.

Guess what! I'm doing amazing right now, and I'm being real. I'm not lying anymore about how I'm doing hehe, sorry about that again. You can definitely talk about me now and it'd be a real thing ah? 

Though, I probably won't look into having a love life for a while now, who knew it's so nice having this much peace and a few friends. 

Ang haba nanamn neto, whatever!!!!!!!! >:C

Pag nabasa mo na 'to, baka naman pwede na ulit tayo maging best friends? You da goat btw, hehe. That's all for now, talk to you when we finally decide to be friends again! Bye bye, Win!!!!
