<li align="left"><Font face="Gill Sans MT" Font size="3"> <b>Nahuhulog Na Sayo</b> - sa lyrics pa nga lang halata na kung bakit kita natatandaan tuwing nagpaplay tong kanta na toh eh.
<br>
Yung pagdinig ko palang ng pangalan mo kinikilig na ko, yung notif mo, yung galawan mo, yung boses mo. Basta kapag ikaw
<br>
naalala ko, napapangiti nalang ako dito ng wala sa oras. Di ka ba naaawa sakin? Lahat nalang ng ginagawa mo sakin,
<br>
naano yung puso ko pls haha. Sa pagtagal padin ng panahon, sayo at sayo lang ako nahuhulog ng ganito.

<li align="left"><Font face="Gill Sans MT" Font size="3"> <b>Love Like You</b> - I never thought na may magmamahal sakin ng ganito. Aswell as magmamahal ako ng kagaya mo, I'm not sure
<br>
kung anong nagustuhan mo sakin eh, ano nga ba? I always thought na I'd be the type that would always experience love that
<br>
would be impossible na mahalin ako pabalik, sinasabi mo na I'm someone special to you, pero what is so special about me? 
<br>
Hays, kahit hindi ko alam kung ano nga ba, ever since you said that you liked me back, I've been trying to love like how you love me,
<br>
we're both still learning about this anyways, it feels nice learning new things with you. Especially <b>love.</b>

<br>
<li align="left"><Font face="Gill Sans MT" Font size="3"> <b>:)</b> - Nakita ko nga lang toh while observing your dc status and started listening to it more bcs of that, ang ganda pala ano?
<br>
This song reminds me of how happy I am while being inlove with someone, kasi kahit sino pa before
<br>
na nagustuhan ko, none of them made me feel loved more than you did. You've been stuck on my mind everyday ever since
<br> 
narealize ko na I really am inlove with you and it's the happy kind of love, the love that I have rarely experienced from anyone at all. 
<br>
You were the reason I started believing in love more than I have ever had before.

<li align="left"><Font face="Gill Sans MT" Font size="3"> <b>Pano</b> - This song makes me reminisce the November phase we had, the silence for a week between us.
<br>
The time na I was half umaasa, half sumusuko na haha. The convincing na "hala ginanon lang ako ni win? pero nagsabi siya na hndi naman nya ako iiwan?"
<br>
the first week of you disappearing, ewan ko ba kung manhid ka or what pero pinapahalata ko na sa fb na ikaw ang namimiss ko eh.
<br>
kasi bigla ka namang nawala, no explanation, nothing. Sabi ko hindi na ko magiging marupok sayo and I'll start moving on, I'll start studying first.
<br> 
Yun nga yung nangyari nung una, pero hindi padin mapigilan yung mga luha na naubos every night. Pero the thought na you left me still lingers in my mind.
<br>
I did so many thing to distract myself pero nung bumalik ka, dun ko narealize na there really wasn't any letting go of my feelings for you.
<br> 
Delikado na talaga ako pagdating sayo eh.

<li align="left"><Font face="Gill Sans MT" Font size="3"> <b>Valentine</b> - I haven't felt genuinely admired or loved by anyone (sounds dark pero eh). You're the
<br>
first one to ever like me back and it's scary because everytime you say "I love you", I feel like I have someone to lose now. I've never believed anyone when
<br>
they call me pretty and stuff so I usually just joke around, pero pagdating sayo I legit try to think of a response
<br>
I've fallen for you and the moment that I did, surprised me. I've never thought someone as unexpected as you, would be the person I would be falling for.
<br>
Every "I love you", I can feel my heartbeat going faster, my eyes sparkling, and my mind suddenly feels relaxed the moment you say it. 
<br> 
Time really flies fast when spent with the right person, buti nalang ano?

<br>
<li align="left"><Font face="Gill Sans MT" Font size="3"> <b>Maybe Maybe</b> - I placed the imaginary friendzone between us even tho I knew well that I liked you
<br>
more than a friend. I knew you didn't like me back before so I threw away the idea of confessing to you. The only chance I'd get of you
<br>
exchanging mutual feelings is if it's platonic ones, so I just made it that way. I was supposed to admire you from a distance and a boundary.
<br>
Habang tumatagal, I wanted you to be aware of how amazing you actually are, how you can just easily fix my mood with one notification.
<br>
There was no point in confessing before, I would've just gotten hurt instead of you liking me back. I waited for the moment, and did it. And here we are now.

<br>
<li align="left"><Font face="Gill Sans MT" Font size="3"> <b>Dinamalayan</b> - My feelings for you were the least expected to be turned into romantic. This song
<br>
perfectly describes how I feel around you. Kahit the thought of you can make me smile ng hindi ko namamalayan.
<br> 
Time stops whenever we make eye contact and my mind starts panicking because wala akong masabi sayo.
<br> 
Kung yung nararamdaman ko sayo hindi ko namalayan na nandun, mas lalo na nung napansin kong nakangiti ka rin sa akin.
<br>
Minamasdan kita tuwing nagsasalita ka lang infront of me noong nagmeet-up tayo before, ang daldal mo eh, naano talaga ako ahaha..

<br>
<li align="left"><Font face="Gill Sans MT" Font size="3"> <b>THE SHADE</b> - This reminds me of the time na nilagay mo yung lyrics neto sa about me mo sa discord hehe.
<br>
"I would love to be stuck to your side", relatable, I wanted to freeze the moment nung bday mo just so I could stay
<br>
by your side a little longer. Your presence is just so comforting kasi my mind wasn't processing the moment during that time.
<br>
If only you didn't leave so soon, I would've actually processed and enjoyed the moment at its finest hays.
</li>
<br>

<br>
<br>
<li align="left"><Font face="Gill Sans MT" Font size="3"> <b>Yakap</b> - Pangalan mo palang nababanggit sakin araw araw, lagi nalang ako nanghihina at nahihiya.
<br>
Each time na nakita kita, nagtitiis lang ako and nagbubuild up ng courage para mayakap ka. Ewan ko ba pero
<br>
yakap mo na ngayon ang lagi kong ninanais, lalo na kapag malamig yung panahon. Lagi nga akong niyayakap nung
<br> 
classmate ko pero wala, ikaw lang naman gusto ko makayakap kahit isang beses lang. Haha, pero till now wala padin akong lakas ng loob.
<br>
Di ko talaga kaya, pagtingin ko palang sayo nakakapanghina na eh.
</li>
<br>
<img src="yakap.jpg" width="15%" length="15%">
<br>
<br>
<li align="left"><Font face="Gill Sans MT" Font size="3"> <b>Ikaw Lang</b> - Your eyes shine like the stars at night, ang ganda talaga titigan. Nakakamangha talaga
<br>
yung pagtingin mo sakin, di ko talaga inakala na mahuhulog ka rin sa akin. I can reassure you na ikaw lang po talaga
<br> 
ang iniibig ko till now and till how far we could go. Iibigan kita kahit gano ka pa katagal mawala kasi I'm sure sakin at sakin
<br>
ka parin babalik, may tiwala ako sayo na hindi basta basta masisira just because you disappeared for a few days.
<br>
Mawala ka man for a while, pagbalik mo, ikaw lang ang taong makakakuha ng nararamdaman ko.

<br>
<li align="left"><Font face="Gill Sans MT" Font size="3"> <b>Pasilyo</b> - Kinikilig talaga ako tuwing nagpaplay to eh, wala naalala lagi kita.
<br>
Tuwing nagpaplay toh sa school, I just look at my friend then just talk about how much I miss you. 
<br> 
You have me hooked unto you without even having any idea of it, everytime na bumabanat ka sa umaga, this song 
<br>
is coincidentally the one playing all the time, so I legit feel weak by every single thing you say.
<br> 
Wdym need ko ng kape eh pwede namang yung mga banat mo nalang? Hehe, Ikaw at ikaw lang ang nakakapaganito sakin.
<br>
Ikaw lang kasi di naman ako napayag kung iba pa.

<img src="pasilyo.jpg" width="15%" length="15%">
<br>
<br>
<li align="left"><Font face="Gill Sans MT" Font size="3"> <b>Paninindigan Kita</b> - Yung oras na hindi ka makapaniwala na may nagkakagusto sayo, you couldn't understand why
<br>
siya nagkakagusto sayo. You have so many likable traits about you, pero siguro kapag nilista ko, mananahimik ka nanaman.
<br> 
I know we don't really have any kind of label, pero paninindigan kita whatever you decide on, I'll still continue
<br>
chasing these feelings for you. I'll love you like I'm still chasing you to like me back, to notice me, and to be with me.
<br>
Tuwing lumalapit ka, nawawala talaga angas ko even if tinatry ko pang itago. Matagal na yon nawala sakin, sayong sayo na ko.

<br>
<li align="left"><Font face="Gill Sans MT" Font size="3"> <b>An Art Gallery Could Never Be As Unique As You</b> - Everywhere I go, it's only you that I look for in the crowds of
<br>
different places I've been, hoping to accidentally bump into you. I keep seeing these other people that look like you,
<br>
but nobody can compare to the original masterpiece of a person (you btw). You've been my favorite sight to see ever
<br>
since I walked past you in the hallway before. Everything you've done makes me realize how much I indeed love you.
</li>
<br>
<img src="artgallery.jpg" width="15%" length="15%">
<br>
<li align="left"><Font face="Gill Sans MT" Font size="3"> <b>Let You Break My Heart Again</b> - I had planned to move on from you the moment I realized you were ignoring me, I convinced
<br>
myself that you didn't care about me as much as I cared about you. I would stop falling inlove with you, then I
<br> 
would somehow finally find someone that would like me as much as I liked you, it was only in the matter of dreams that we were
<br>
more than friends. But the final plot twist was you, you really changed my mind. You were the someone that liked me as much as I liked you.
<br> 
If I were to choose someone who could break my heart and I'd still love them, it would be you.
<br> 
I don't care as long as you do it, I'm okay as long as you do it. You are an exception to me.
